# Feature Engineering
    - for Causal Analysis: Preparing Data for "Impact of Interest Rate Changes on S&P 500"

    To better utilize the data for causal analysis, we need to preprocess and engineer features that help us analyze the relationship between interest rate changes and the S&P 500 index.

âœ… Features
Before analyzing S&P 500 data, let's generate additional variables (features) to enhance the study.

ðŸ“Œ New Features to Add:

Daily Returns
    â†’ (Current Closing Price - Previous Closing Price) / Previous Closing Price
Moving Average
    â†’ The average closing price over a specific period

    #### Moving Average (MA) Interpretation
    ðŸ“Œ How to Interpret Moving Averages

    Short-term Moving Average (20-day MA) â†’ Shows the average price trend over the past month.
    Medium-term Moving Average (50-day MA) â†’ Reflects the price movement over the past few months.

    â†’ Death Cross: Bearish signal (potential downtrend).


Volatility (Standard Deviation)
    â†’ A metric to analyze market fluctuations
Volume Change Rate
    â†’ (Current Trading Volume - Previous Trading Volume) / Previous Trading Volume
